    <p>Task: KachiBros has been rapidly expanding its product offerings. The start-up utilizes AWS to host its web applications, manage its databases, and store sensitive customer data. As the company grows, so does the number of employees who need access to these AWS resources. So, to enhance security, the company has decided to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all AWS accounts within the company. </p>
Description: 
The AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), is a security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to your AWS account by requiring both your password and a code from your MFA device. As such, it requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to AWS resources, making unauthorized access significantly more difficult.</p>
